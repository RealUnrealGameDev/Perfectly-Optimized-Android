**Perfectly Optimized** is a Unreal Engine 5 starter template made to deliver performance gains on lower-end hardware.

Unreal Engine 5’s default configuration prioritizes ray-traced global illumination and virtualized geometry. While systems such as **Nanite** and **Lumen** work effectively on modern GPUs, they can overwhelm older GPUs and integrated graphics.

This template changes the UE5 rendering pipeline for **stability and low GPU cost**, delivering performance closer to Unity forward rendered games.

## Overview

- Vulkan-based rendering  
- High-end UE5 rendering features disabled by default  
- Optimized for high and stable frame rates on mobile (android)
- Clean, lightweight template for performance  

---

## Key Modifications

### Rendering Backend

- Switched to **Vulkan**
- Improved compatibility with mobile and VR systems
- Reduced shader runtime cost

### Anti-Aliasing

- Anti-aliasing disabled

### Lighting Pipeline

- **Lumen fully disabled**
- No real-time global illumination or reflections

### Geometry and Virtualization

- **Nanite disabled by default**
- Avoids virtualized geometry processing

### Reduced Package Size

- **Disabled Prerequisites installer**
- Exclude Editor Content While Cooking
- Exclude Movies while staging

### Additional Performance-Focused Changes

- Reduced unecessary post processing
- Virtual Shadow Maps disabled
- Clean project configuration with no unnecessary runtime systems

## Intended Use Cases

- Developers targeting VR Systems and Mobile Games
- Performance-sensitive prototypes and experiments  
- Indie projects requiring a lightweight UE5 Project
- Stylized, low-poly, or small-scale 3D projects  
- Developers transitioning from Unity rendering to UE5

---

## What This Template Is Not

- Not a gameplay framework  
- Not a visual showcase  
- Not a Nanite or Lumen demonstration  
- Not intended for high-end or cinematic rendering

This template exists to provide a **clean, fast, and predictable starting point** for Unreal Engine 5 projects where performance is a primary concern.
